I chose react for my architectural framework because react is the most popular js framework these days. ReactJS is a JavaScript library that combines the speed of JavaScript and uses a new way of rendering web pages, making them highly dynamic and responsive to user input. 
I use Material UI for my layout framework, which is a CSS library featured in React components.Material UI contains components and tool systems. I chose it because it can combine my components easily.
I use formik for my validation framework . Formik is builded under react,so the react users can easily use it in their project. For me, formik validation forms can easily combine with my components which help me a lot.
